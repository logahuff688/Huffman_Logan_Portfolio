WEBSITE / PAGE LAYOUT / DESIGN DOCUMENT:

HOMEPAGE 	    -  Top left, text that says (my name) (which also acts as a button to get back home), followed by an image of me behind my name and black header behind both.
         	    -  On the rectangle, there are two buttons (one says "Graphic Designs", and then the other says "Videos".
         	    -  Bottom - The Footer, which has two buttons on the far left side. One being Github (which takes you to my Github profile), and another for Linkedin (which takes you to my Linkedin profile).

GRAPHIC DESIGN PAGE - Top left, basically the same but the text is changed to "Graphic Design". Black Rectangle to the right until the end that acts as the 'header'.
                    - Top Right, where the sub-categories are (for "Graphic Design)" as buttons. - there are 8 sub-categories, that are all buttons that function as a refresh button based on which you click.
                      The buttons, are as follows: "Banners", "game icons", "gamepasses", "Logos", "Photoshops", "Profile Pictures", "UI" (which has more sub-categories), and are going to act as refresh buttons that refresh the images based on that sub-category.
                    - Center Left, where the images / past creations of mine (Graphic Design wise) are going to be displayed in Photographs, which can be refreshed to a new sub-category by using the buttons along the top right (as stated previously).
                    -  Bottom - The Footer, which has two buttons on the far left side. One being Github (which takes you to my Github profile), and another for Linkedin (which takes you to my Linkedin profile).


VIDEOS PAGE           Top left, basically the same as the second page (Graphic Design), but the text is changed to "Videos".
                      Middle - Still buttons, which is where I am going to use the same idea/concept as the Photograph idea from before, but have videos sitting in some sort of TV or something related.
                      Underneath the video is a rectangle with the title of the video and a short description of said video.
                      spread out throughout the span of the middle, middle but down a bit more, and/or middle-left.
                    - Center Left, where there are different videos to choose from that were made by Logan in the past.
                    - Bottom - footer from previous pages.

ABOUT PAGE          - top left - like the homepage, where the text says my name and acts as a home button, followed by an image of me and black header behind both.
		    - top right - back button (which also acts as a button to go back home)
		    - Middle - an introduction and description of me, where i'm from and live, and what I specialize in design-wise.
		      Followed by that, there's a button which takes you to a blank email to me when clicked. Text on the button says "Contact Me".
		    - Bottom - footer from previous pages.
