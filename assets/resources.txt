WEBSITE / PAGE LAYOUT:

HOMEPAGE -  Top left, text that says (my name) (which also acts as a button to get back home), followed by an image of me behind my name & a black rectangle to the right.
         -  On the rectangle, there are two buttons (one says "Graphic Design", and then the other says "Videos" or something along those lines)

GRAPHIC DESIGN PAGE - Top left, basically the same but the text is changed to "Graphic Design". Black Rectangle to the right until the end that acts as the 'header'.
                    - Top Right, where the sub-categories are introduced (for "Graphic Design)" as buttons - there are 8 sub-categories, that are all buttons that function as a refresh button based on which you click.
                      The buttons, are as follows: "Banners", "game icons", "gamepasses", "Logos", "Photoshops", "Profile Pictures", "UI" (which has more sub-categories), and are going to act as refresh buttons that refresh the images based on that sub-category.
                    - Center Left, where the images / past creations of mine (Graphic Design wise) are displayed, which can be refreshed to a new sub-category by using the buttons along the top right (as stated previously).

VIDEOS PAGE -         Top left, basically the same as the second page (Graphic Design), but the text is changed to "Videos".
                      Middle - Still buttons, which is where I am going to use the same idea/concept as the Printer idea, but have videos sitting in some sort of TV or something related.
                      Underneath the video is a rectangle with the title of the video and a short description of said video. There are three different TV-like images & descriptions / titles
                      spread out throughout the span of the middle, middle but down a bit more, and/or middle-left.
                    - Center Left, where there are different videos to choose from that were made by Logan in the past that are viewable.
